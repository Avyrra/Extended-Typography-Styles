# Extended-Typography-Styles
Allows more control of typography styles in Obsidian when using the Style Settings community plugin.

## HOW TO INSTALL
Download **Extended Typography Styles.css**
- Open your Obsidian Vaults snippet folder. This folder can be accessed by clicking the folder icon at the bottom of the appearance menu or by navigating to vaultname/.obsidian/snippets
- Move **Extended Typography Styles.css** to the snippets folder.
- Install and Enable Style Settings via Community Plugins > Browse > Search: Style Settings

A new menu will appear in settings called Style Settings. All Extended Typography Parameters will then be accessible from that menu.


### Note
Parameter defaults and limitations are set by me. If the limitations are too restrictive for your tastes, you can edit them via the css file.
For best experience, ensure that all changes are made to both that YAML section and the CSS sections of the file.
